# Project--System-to-Combat-Violence
This project was undertaken as part of the course “Computer Networks “with the aim of developing a system for recording, alerting, preventing, and combating violence against professionals in the health sector. The project involves the use of both TCP and UDP sockets. The project is composed of the following components:
-AAS (Aplicação para o Agente de Segurança- “Security Agent Aplication”): This application enables security agents to assess incidents of violence (this search is performed with a filtering process).
-AC (Aplicação Central- “Central Aplication”): This algorithm is the central application where all the other applications interact via sockets. This application contains the database where the records are kept and the database with the credentials of all the individuals.
-AGS (Aplicação de Gestor do Sistema- “System Manager Application”): This application allows the manager, after authentication, to validate, consult, and delete the registration in the system (health professionals and security agents).
-APS (Aplicação para o Profissional de Saúde – “Healthcare professional Application”): This application allows healthcare professionals, after authentication, to register incidents of violence.
